----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question Set 3 - Advance 

Q1: Find how much amount spent by each customer on artists? Write a query to return customer name, artist name and total spent

Steps to Solve: First, find which artist has earned the most according to the InvoiceLines.
Now use this artist to find which customer spent the most on this artist. 
For this query, you will need to use the Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track, Customer, Album, and Artist tables.
Note, this one is tricky because the Total spent in the Invoice table might not be on a single product, 
so you need to use the InvoiceLine table to find out how many of each product was purchased, and then multiply this by the price for each artist.


with best_selling_artist as(
select artist.artist_id as artist_id,artist.name as artist_name,sum(invoice_line.unit_price * invoice_line.quantity)as total_sales
from invoice_line join track on track.track_id = invoice_line.track_id
join album on album.album_id = track.album_id
join artist on artist.artist_id = album.artist_id 
group by 1 order by 3 desc limit 1)

select c.customer_id,c.first_name,c.last_name, bsa.artist_name,sum(il.unit_price * il.quantity) as amount_spent from invoice i
join customer c on c.customer_id = i.customer_id
join invoice_line il on il.invoice_id = i.invoice_id 
join track t on t.track_id = il.track_id
join album alb on alb.album_id = t.album_id
join best_selling_artist bsa on bsa.artist_id = alb.artist_id 
group by 1,2,3,4
order by 5 desc;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q2: We want to find out the most popular music Genre for each country.
We determine the most popular genre as the genre with the highest amount of purchases. 
Write a query that returns each country along with the top Genre.
For countries where the maximum number of purchases is shared return all Genres.
Steps to Solve:  There are two parts in question- first most popular music genre and second need data at country level. 

Method 1: Using CTE

with popular_genre as (
select count(invoice_line.quantity) as purchases, customer.country,genre.name,genre.genre_id,
Row_number() over (partition by customer.country order by count(invoice_line.quantity) desc)as RowNo
from invoice_line 
join invoice on invoice.invoice_id = invoice_line.invoice_id
join customer on customer.customer_id = invoice.customer_id
join track on track.track_id = invoice_line.track_id
join genre on genre.genre_id = track.genre_id 
group by 2,3,4
order by 2 asc, 1 desc )

select * from popular_genre where RowNo<=1;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q3: Write a query that determines the customer that has spent the most on music for each country. 
Write a query that returns the country along with the top customer and how much they spent. 
For countries where the top amount spent is shared, provide all customers who spent this amount
Steps to Solve:  Similar to the above question. There are two parts in question- first find 
the most spent on music for each country and second filter the data for respective customers. 

with customer_with_country as(
select customer.customer_id,first_name,last_name,billing_country, sum(total)as total_spending,
ROW_NUMBER() over(PARTITION BY billing_country order by sum(total) desc) as RowNo
from invoice join customer on customer.customer_id = invoice.customer_id
group by 1,2,3,4
order by 4 asc,5 desc )
select * from customer_with_country where RowNo<= 1;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
select * from customer;
select * from invoice;
